'''
Purpose: Illustrate the benefits of using objects.

Contains a class (template) representing a generic numeric list of data that can include a name and units to describe the data.

By starting with this class, we can create a subclass (child) that adds additional attributes and methods to the parent class.

For example, see numeric_weather_series.py for a child class that adds a location attribute to a set of temperature readings
