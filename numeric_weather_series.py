'''
Purpose: Create a class that inherits everything from NumericSeries and adds
attributes and/or behavior specific to Weather. 

If you don't need to add specialized attributes or behavior, 
you can just use the original NumericSeries class directly. 
No subclassing required.

We get all of our parent's attributes and methods for free (no coding required).

Weather adds:

- a location attribute
