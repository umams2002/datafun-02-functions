This example illustrates basic analytics
using just the built-in statistics module.

VS Code Menu / View / Command Palette / Python Interpretor
Must be 3.10 or greater to get the correlation and linear regression.

To update, try:
conda update pythnon -y
conda --version

Uses only Python Standard Library module:

- statistics - for basic descriptive and a bit of predictive stats
